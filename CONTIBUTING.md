# Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and comments for this project are greatly
appreciated.

## Communication

The best way to commuicate to the individuals working on the project
is via project issues. If you find a bug or have a suggestion please
create an issue
(`https://github.com/ciena/gns3ctl/issues`).

## Code Contributions

Code contributions should be submitted via pull requests. Currently
the process is fairly lienient because of the number of contributors.
As the number of contributors increases policies will be put in place
to help insure code quality, such as the individual that submits
a merge request cannot be the same individual that merges the request.

## Unit Tests

Please include appropriate unit tests when submitting code. Current
the project is lienient on this point, but strictness around this point
will increase with greater use of the project as well as greater number
of contributors.
